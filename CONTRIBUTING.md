# Contribution Guideline

*Welcome One and All, Thank you for considering to contribute to Hivemind.*

Before contributing go through the various guidelines pertaining to the Repository.

## Found a Bug?

In a situation in which a bug is encountered, create an Issue with the label `Bug`.

Make sure the Issue has :

- A descriptive and clear title.
- A Description of the exact steps to reproduce the bug.
- An example of the output or log of the problem.

## Want to Solve an Issue?

If you find an Issue you would like to tackle, comment on the Issue for a maintainer to assign the Issue to you if not already assigned.

After an Issue is assigned to you make sure your Environment is setup correctly. Follow the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/RuItech/HiveMind#installation) for help in setting up your environment.

In this repository, we use [Git Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). As such in the creation of a PR use seperate branch other than `master` to commit changes.

Last of all, all new code / feautures to the codebase should be properly tested and documented if needed.

## Need Help?

In the event that clarification is needed, feel free to contact the maintainers of this repository. Namely:
